A Linux C program to test and classify orthodox chess problems. It will eventually deal
with directmates, selfmates, relfexmates, helpmates and their stalemate equivalents.

Input is taken from the program options and output is xml on stdout. It will run on
the command line, but is designed to be called from a graphical front end, yet to
be written. A Windows version will eventually be produced.

It uses:
    genx (an xml library by Tim Bray)
    an md5 library by Peter Deutsch
    uthash.h, utarray.h, utlist.h and utstring.h by Tory Hanson

It is still in development, so don't expect it to work just yet.
